## Current Status (2025)

**Evidence FOR quantum consciousness**:
- Quantum vibrations in microtubules confirmed
- Anesthetics affect quantum processes in MTs
- Superradiance demonstrated at room temperature
- Brain entanglement signals detected (Trinity College)
- Energy migration exceeds classical predictions

**Evidence AGAINST or uncertain**:
- Gravity-collapse mechanism (simplest version) ruled out
- Decoherence times still debated
- Hard to explain how quantum effects survive in warm brain
- No direct proof quantum effects cause consciousness (correlation ≠ causation)

**Verdict**: The hypothesis is more plausible than it was in 2000, but not proven. The tide has shifted from dismissal to serious consideration.
